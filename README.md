# Ugolino

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Zeegomo/ugolino.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Zeegomo/ugolino)  

Free (as in free speech) app for MQTT interaction.

Currently supports (v 0.2.0 testing):
* Send simple switch(0/1) to custom broker and topic (Add->Switch)
* Display text read from custom topic and broker (Add->Read)
* TLS/SSL encrypted connection
* Password authentication
* I'm going to implement a very useful android application to use in order to improve this app
